I decided to use the redux toolkit for managing the state of this application. As for the user interface, I've utilized the 'shadcn-ui' library

I've completed all assigned tasks and all additional ones. Furthermore, I've created an item page that displays Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) corresponding to list items, allowing users to interact with them. Additionally, I've included a feature to switch between day and night modes in the application. If you have any further inquiries, please don't hesitate to ask.

I looking forward to hearing back from you.
